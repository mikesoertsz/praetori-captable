Cap Table Evolution for a Dual-Use Defense/AI Startup (Aggressive Scenario)

This report outlines a realistic yet aggressive capitalization table scenario for a dual-use software defense startup (inspired by companies like Palantir, Helsing, and Anduril). The company raises multiple funding rounds – Seed, Series A, Series B, Series C – with high valuations that help minimize founder dilution. Each round includes an employee stock option pool (ESOP) refresh to 10% post-money, and there are no secondary sales or liquidity events. We show the ownership breakdown after each round (Seed through Series C), explain how the cap table shifts, and compare the trajectory to typical norms for high-growth defense/AI ventures.

Key assumptions and highlights:

Founders’ Equity: Founders begin with 100% ownership. We assume they retain a large majority post-Seed and negotiate high valuations in each round to limit dilution. This is aggressive but plausible for a startup with strong traction or renowned founders (e.g. founders often retain ~60–70% after a seed round, but with strong positioning they can keep even more
_equitylist.co_
).

Seed Round (€10M for 8%): A €10M seed raise for only 8% equity implies a post-money valuation of ~€125M, which is very high for Seed. This sets the stage for minimal dilution (founders keep ~82%). An ESOP equal to 10% of the company is created post-round to incentivize hires.

Each Subsequent Round: The Series A, B, C are each large raises (≥€60M, ~€200M, and sized to reach €1B+ valuation, respectively). In each round, new investors come in for a relatively modest stake (aggressively low dilution percentages), and the ESOP is topped back up to 10% post-money (which slightly dilutes existing holders each time
_equitylist.co_
). We assume no secondary sales, so every funding is primary capital that increases the share count and dilutes existing stakeholders.

Below we detail each round’s cap table and how ownership shifts, followed by a summary of cumulative dilution and a comparison to industry benchmarks.

Seed Round – €10M Seed Investment (8% Equity Sold)

Round details: The startup raises €10 million at the seed stage by selling 8% of the company’s equity to seed investors. This yield a post-money valuation of ~€125 million (since €10M is 8% of the post-money). As part of this round, a new employee stock option pool (ESOP) is created, set at 10% of the post-money capitalization (a common requirement by investors to ensure room for new hires). There are no prior investors, so dilution only affects the founders’ stake.

Cap table after Seed:

Shareholder Post-Seed Ownership (%)
Founders (combined) 82.0%
Seed Investors 8.0%
ESOP Pool (unallocated) 10.0%

Explanation: Before this round, founders held 100%. After the €10M investment, founders own 82% of the company (diluted by the new shares for investors and the ESOP). The seed investor(s) hold 8%. The remaining 10% is the ESOP reserve created post-money. Founders experienced an 18 percentage-point dilution at seed (from 100% to 82%). This founder retention is unusually high – founders typically retain ~60–70% after a seed round in many startups
_equitylist.co_
. Achieving 82% indicates a very competitive valuation and possibly strong credentials or tech, similar to how some elite defense tech startups raise big seed rounds at high valuations. This scenario assumes the startup had exceptional promise (e.g. strategic technology or successful founders), letting it raise €10M for only 8%. The 10% ESOP means that part of the dilution came from setting aside options for future employees – importantly, creating the option pool effectively comes out of the founders’ ownership (investors typically insist the pool be created pre-money, which dilutes the founders’ stake rather than the new investor’s
_equitylist.co_
).

Series A – €60M Venture Round (Post-Money ESOP 10%)

Round details: Approximately 18–24 months later, the company raises a Series A of €60 million. We assume new Series A investors negotiate roughly a 15% post-money stake in exchange for this €60M investment. This implies a post-money valuation of ~€400M (since €60M/€400M = 15%). The pre-money valuation would be about €340M. As part of this round, the employee option pool is topped back up to 10% post-money. (Some of the original 10% ESOP may have been used to hire early team members; regardless, the pool is refreshed to 10% of the new total shares post-Series A.) No secondary liquidity is taken by founders.

Cap table after Series A:

Shareholder Post-Series A Ownership (%)
Founders (combined) 61.5%
Seed Investor(s) 6.0%
Series A Investor(s) 15.0%
ESOP Pool (unallocated) 10.0%

Explanation: The founders’ stake falls to ~61.5% after Series A, down from 82%. In other words, the founders have now been diluted by roughly 38.5 percentage points from the company’s inception (they retain ~61.5% of the company vs. 100% originally). The seed investors, who were at 8%, are diluted to about 6.0%. The new Series A investors receive 15% ownership. The ESOP pool is reset to 10% post-money (if the pool had dropped below 10% due to the new shares, additional shares are authorized to bring it to 10%).

Notably, the founder ownership (61.5%) is still quite high for post-Series A. By comparison, a more typical scenario with substantial seed and Series A rounds might have founders owning ~50–60% after A
_equitylist.co_
_equitylist.co_
. Our scenario reflects an aggressive valuation: selling only 15% for €60M means the company was valued very richly at this stage. This could be justified by strong progress (e.g. technology demonstrations or contracts) and the strategic interest in defense AI startups. For context, venture dilution norms have been trending downward in recent years – e.g. the average Series A in 2022 involved ~20% dilution, whereas a decade prior it was ~30%
_tomtunguz.com_
. Achieving just 15% dilution at Series A is aggressive but not unheard of in hot markets.

It’s important to recognize that the 10% ESOP refresh contributes to dilution as well. Investors often require the company to create or increase an option pool before the round closes, effectively diluting existing shareholders (mostly founders) to make room for future hires
_equitylist.co_
. In this case, the pool is maintained at 10% after the round, aligning with the term sheet requirement each round. The founders absorb the dilution from this pool expansion (the new investors still end up with their full 15%). This practice is common and is often called “option pool shuffle” or hidden dilution – as a result, founders end up giving more total percentage away than the investor’s stake alone would suggest, to ensure the ESOP is at the desired level
_equitylist.co_
.

Series B – ~€200M Growth Round (Pre-Unicorn Funding)

Round details: The startup continues to scale (e.g. product in deployment, growing contracts), and raises a Series B of approximately €200 million. In this scenario, we’ll assume Series B investors negotiate about a 25% ownership post-money for that investment. This implies a post-money valuation of ~€800M (making the pre-money valuation ~€600M). A 25% new stake is somewhat on the higher end, but we assume the company opted to take a very large capital injection (to fuel R&D, global expansion, etc.) at a slightly lower valuation multiple to ensure sufficient funding. As with prior rounds, the ESOP pool is refreshed to 10% post-money again at Series B. No secondaries are taken; all €200M is primary capital.

Cap table after Series B:

Shareholder Post-Series B Ownership (%)
Founders (combined) 40.0%
Seed Investor(s) 3.9%
Series A Investor(s) 9.8%
Series B Investor(s) 25.0%
ESOP Pool (unallocated) 10.0%

Explanation: After this large Series B, the founders’ stake is reduced to roughly ~40% of the company. This marks a significant dilution from the ~61.5% at Series A. By now the founders have given up about 60 percentage points of ownership from the start (100% → ~40%). Nevertheless, holding 40% after raising hundreds of millions is still a strong position for founders – they remain the largest single block and retain substantial control. Early investors have been diluted further: the seed investors go from 6.0% to ~3.9%, and the Series A investors from 15% to ~9.8%. The new Series B investors come in owning 25.0% of the company. The ESOP is again 10% after the round (it would have fallen to ~8% if not topped up, due to the influx of new shares for the B round, so the company issues additional shares to bring it back to 10% post-money).

Granting 25% to the Series B investor is slightly above the typical range – traditionally VCs often aim for ~20% in each significant round. (For instance, historical averages show Series B rounds often in the 15–25% dilution range
_tomtunguz.com_
.) In recent years, especially for strong companies, Series B dilution has sometimes been lower (around 12–15% on average in 2022
_tomtunguz.com_
). In our scenario, 25% was given for €200M, reflecting either a somewhat more investor-favorable deal or simply the necessity of a large check size relative to the company’s valuation at that time. Even so, the company’s post-money valuation (~€800M) is very high for a Series B. This is comparable to the trajectory of high-profile defense tech startups. For example, Anduril (a U.S. defense tech company) reached a $1B+ valuation by what was effectively its Series B – in 2019 Anduril raised ~$120M at a valuation over $1B
_en.wikipedia.org_
. By mid-2020 (roughly Series C), Anduril raised another $200M and doubled its valuation to ~$2B
_en.wikipedia.org_
. Our startup’s ~€800M valuation post-Series B is slightly shy of unicorn status, but it sets the stage for Series C to push into “unicorn” territory. In the European context, companies like Helsing followed a similar path: by its Series B in 2023, Helsing had raised over €300M total and was reportedly valued in the high hundreds of millions (exact valuation undisclosed), on the way to unicorn status
_clay.com_
_clay.com_
.

It’s worth noting that by this stage the founders’ ownership falling to ~40% is expected in venture-backed companies – founders are no longer majority owners. However, 40% is still a larger share than many founders might have by Series B when multiple investors and option pools have taken slices. The founders’ healthy stake here is a direct result of the high valuations and relatively low equity sold in earlier rounds (only 8% at seed, 15% at A) as well as careful control of dilution. Many traditional startups that raise successive rounds (Seed through B) could see founders dip closer to ~30% or less by this point if each round gave 20%+ to investors plus option pool expansions
_equitylist.co_
_equitylist.co_
. Our scenario demonstrates a best-case for founder equity at Series B, enabled by the company’s strong leverage in fundraising.

Series C – Mega-Round to Achieve Unicorn Status (€1B+ Valuation)

Round details: For the Series C, the company aims to firmly establish itself as a unicorn (valuation ≥ €1 billion). The raise is sized accordingly. We assume the startup raises approximately €150 million in Series C. Given the momentum and competition to invest, the new Series C investors accept about a 15% post-money stake for this capital. This puts the post-money valuation around €1.0 billion (if exactly €150M for 15%, post-money would be €1,000M). The pre-money valuation is roughly €850M. Once again, the ESOP pool is refreshed to 10% post-money as part of the round (ensuring continued ability to grant stock to employees as the team grows into the hundreds). This Series C could be led by large growth equity or strategic investors, and it brings total funding raised by the company to around €420M. No liquidity is taken by founders or earlier investors in this round.

Cap table after Series C:

Shareholder Post-Series C Ownership (%)
Founders (combined) 30.0%
Seed Investor(s) 2.9%
Series A Investor(s) 7.3%
Series B Investor(s) 18.8%
Series C Investor(s) 15.0%
ESOP Pool (unallocated) 10.0%

Explanation: After the Series C, the founders hold roughly 30% of the company. This is the culmination of several rounds of dilution (meaning the founders have given up ~70 percentage points of ownership from the start). Importantly, 30% is still a substantial stake at this stage – the founders remain very influential shareholders. The seed investors end up with only about 2.9%, down from their 8% at seed (early investors often get heavily diluted by later, larger rounds – here the seed investors’ stake has been more than halved from the 6% they had post-A). The Series A investors hold around 7.3% (down from 15% at entry). Series B investors end up with about 18.8%, slightly under the 25% they owned post-B (they too were diluted by the Series C new shares). The new Series C investor(s) come in at 15.0% ownership. The ESOP remains at 10% post-money (some new option shares were likely created to top it back up from perhaps ~8–9% pre-round). By now, many of those ESOP shares might be allocated to employees; however, for cap table simplicity we show it as one block of 10%.

At this milestone, the company’s valuation is about €1 billion (unicorn status), supported by €420M total capital raised. This trajectory aligns with the upper end of industry norms for fast-scaling defense/AI startups. For instance, European defense AI startup Helsing reached a $5.4B valuation by its Series C in 2024
_clay.com_
(with a €450M Series C raise), and was reportedly worth €12B by its Series D in 2025 after a further €600M investment
_reuters.com_
. Our startup’s €1.0B valuation at Series C is more conservative by comparison, but it establishes the company as a unicorn with significant funding to execute its vision.

From a dilution standpoint, founders retaining 30% at this stage is a strong outcome. A more typical startup might see founders drop closer to ~20% by the time they’ve raised a Series C or D, especially if early rounds were more dilutive or if multiple co-founders split equity
_equitylist.co_
. In the scenario we’ve modeled, the founders’ aggressive fundraising (high valuations, limiting each investor to relatively small slices) paid off in the form of higher retained ownership. However, a 30% founder stake also reflects the reality of heavy dilution – the founding team went from owning everything to less than one-third of the company. They have been diluted ~70% in total (meaning they own 30% of what they once did). This degree of dilution is expected after several rounds; for comparison, in one analysis founders who raised Seed through Series C ended up around 36% ownership on average (about 63–64% diluted)
_equitylist.co_
. Our founders are a bit below that at 30%, owing to the extra option pool expansions each round and a relatively large Series B dilution (25%). Still, in absolute terms, a 30% stake in a €1B company is a substantial outcome.

Each prior investor’s cumulative dilution can also be observed: for example, the Seed investor started at 8% and is down to ~2.9% by Series C – they’ve lost about 64% of their ownership stake (their holding went from 8% of the pie to roughly one-third of that). Series A investors went from 15% to ~7.3% (about half of their stake diluted away through B and C). Series B investors dropped from 25% to ~18.8%. These decreases happen because new shares were issued in Series C (and each round) that dilute all existing shareholders proportionally. Notably, the later an investor comes in, the less dilution they experience by the next round (since there are fewer rounds after them). The Series C investors in this scenario hold 15% at the end of Series C (having just invested, they haven’t been diluted yet by any future round).

Cumulative Dilution and Comparison to Industry Norms

By the end of Series C, the founders collectively own ~30% of the company. This means they gave up ~70% of the company’s equity across the Seed through Series C rounds. Such dilution is significant, but it’s actually moderate to low when compared to typical venture-backed startups that reach unicorn status. Many founders owning ~30% at a unicorn stage indicates they fared well in negotiations. In some cases, founders of high-growth startups might fall below 20% after multiple rounds (especially if they started with co-founders splitting equity and had larger option pools or investor stakes in each round). In our scenario, the founders’ strong initial position (82% post-seed), coupled with high valuations limiting each round’s dilution (8%, 15%, 25%, 15% sold respectively in rounds), allowed them to stay at a comparatively high 30%. This is in line with an aggressive fundraising strategy. By contrast, if a company followed a more “standard” dilution path (say ~20% to investors each round, plus option pools), founders could end up closer to one-quarter or less ownership by Series C. For instance, a model in which each round (Seed, A, B, C) took 20% would leave founders around 36% by post-Series C
_equitylist.co_
(and even less if the seed had multiple co-founders and a pre-seed pool). Our founders are slightly below that at 30% because we explicitly refreshed a sizable ESOP each time (which hits founder equity) and had a relatively dilutive Series B. Nonetheless, 30% is a robust stake that would be envied by many founders at this stage.

It’s important to highlight how each 10% ESOP refresh impacted the cap table. Across four rounds, roughly 40% of the company (10% each time) was set aside for current and future employees. While not all of that pool may be granted at once, it’s a crucial part of attracting talent in the defense and AI sector, where competition for skilled engineers is fierce. The repeated pool top-ups did dilute the founders and investors, but this is standard practice – investors want to ensure employees will be incentivized going forward. In fact, venture deals often condition the funding on creating an option pool of a certain size upfront
_equitylist.co_
. Founders who don’t plan for this can be taken by surprise at how much “hidden” dilution comes from option pool creation. In our scenario, we assumed everyone was prepared for it, and each round’s ownership percentages already account for the new pool.

Comparing to industry norms: This cap table reflects a company that is outperforming typical metrics and thus securing high valuations. In 2025, defense and AI startups are attracting unprecedented capital, often at hefty valuations due to their strategic importance. As noted in venture analyses, founders are selling less equity per round now than in the past
_tomtunguz.com_
, which aligns with our low dilution percentages (especially at Seed and Series A). High-growth companies in similar domains have raised very large rounds while founders held on to significant equity. For example, Helsing’s founders (and early shareholders) were able to take the company to a multi-billion valuation by Series C – raising over €750M in roughly three years
_clay.com_
_clay.com_
. Anduril’s team also maintained considerable ownership by rapidly increasing valuation: by raising $120M then $200M in back-to-back rounds, they went from a ~$1B to $2B valuation in about a year
_en.wikipedia.org_
_en.wikipedia.org_
, meaning earlier stakeholders saw massive valuation uplift with relatively smaller additional dilution. Our startup’s progression (Seed €125M valuation → Series A €400M → Series B €800M → Series C €1B) is ambitious but mirrors this kind of growth trajectory. Each step roughly doubled or more in valuation – an aggressive pace, yet one seen in top-tier startups in hot sectors.

In terms of founder equity competitiveness, ending with ~30% at >€1B valuation is a strong outcome. It suggests the founders would still have a large say in the company’s direction and a significant economic upside. This is especially important in defense startups, which often have dual-use (commercial and defense) products – maintaining founder vision and control can be crucial when balancing commercial growth with government contracts. The cap table we’ve outlined is founder-friendly, but not implausible given recent market trends. In fact, data indicates that founders today often reach key milestones with less dilution than those a decade ago
_tomtunguz.com_
.

To put it in perspective: by the end of Series C, all early shareholders have been diluted to some extent in exchange for growth capital. The cumulative dilution numbers are as follows:

Founders: ~70% cumulative dilution (from 100% to ~30%). They gave up 18% in Seed, then about 25% more through Series A, then ~35% more through Series B, and ~25% through Series C (not additive in a straight line, but sequentially resulting in 30% remaining). Despite this, retaining 30% is above average for this stage, illustrating the benefit of high valuations. Many founders might only hold ~20% after raising a comparable sum – for example, founders in one model had ~36% after Series C when each round was 20% dilution
_equitylist.co_
, and further rounds (Series D, etc.) can shrink that below 20%. Our founders are in a better spot due to the “aggressive” scenario.

Seed Investor(s): ~64% cumulative dilution relative to their initial stake (from 8.0% post-seed down to ~2.9% post-Series C). This is normal – seed investors expect to be diluted by later rounds. They often end up well under 5% by the time of an exit unless they heavily participate in follow-ons. In our case, the seed investor’s stake was relatively small to begin with (8%), which has dwindled further. Still, in absolute terms, the value of that stake has grown tremendously if the valuation went from €125M to €1B+. (Their 8% at seed was worth €10M; at a €1B valuation, their ~2.9% is worth ~€29M on paper – a strong uplift.)

Series A Investor(s): ~51% cumulative dilution from their entry (15.0% down to ~7.3%). Again, expected as two later rounds came in. If they exercised pro-rata rights in Series B and C (not considered in our simple model), they could have maintained their percentage better. But assuming no extra participation, they now hold about half of their original share. This is still a considerable stake (7.3%) for a large €60M investment, and if the company’s value grew ~3× from their entry (from €400M post to €1B post), their investment’s value has increased substantially.

Series B Investor(s): ~25% dilution from their entry (25.0% to ~18.8%). They only went through one subsequent round (Series C) diluting them. Often later-stage investors face less dilution simply because fewer rounds happen after their entry. If no Series D occurs before exit, the Series B lead may remain one of the top shareholders at ~18–19%. It’s worth noting that many VCs at this stage will continue to invest to maintain ownership. If the Series B investor had pro-rata rights and joined the Series C, they might have kept closer to 25%. Our table assumes no pro-rata to keep it simple (hence the drop to 18.8%).

Series C Investor(s): 0% dilution from their entry at the time of Series C completion – they just invested and hold 15.0%. They would start getting diluted only if a future Series D or other issuance occurs.

Overall, this cap table reflects a balanced outcome for a high-growth startup: founders kept a significant stake (ensuring they are motivated and in control), employees have a healthy 10% pool (crucial in AI/defense for attracting talent), and investors obtained meaningful ownership percentages that align with their typical targets (each major round investor got on the order of 10–25% which is within norms, albeit the lower end of norms in earlier rounds
_tomtunguz.com_
). It’s a scenario where everyone’s incentives are aligned for a big success – the founders and team still stand to gain massively from a future exit/IPO, and investors have enough ownership to see huge returns if the company continues to appreciate beyond €1B (for example, if it doubles to €2B, the Series C investor’s 15% would double their investment value, etc.).

Finally, comparing to known companies: Palantir and others had very complex fundraising histories, but by the time of Palantir’s later rounds, founders’ and early insiders’ ownership had declined significantly due to many rounds (Palantir raised over $2.5B pre-IPO across numerous rounds
_news.crunchbase.com_
). In our streamlined scenario with just four rounds, we avoided excessive dilution. Anduril’s cap table (though private) likely saw founders still with a good chunk by Series C given its rapid valuation climb – our scenario could be seen as analogous. Helsing’s case shows that by Series D, external investors will own the majority (after its €600M Series D, one can infer founders dropped below 20% there, since each big round brings in new stakeholders). Our startup, if it were to raise a Series D (say to push from €1B to €5B valuation), would undergo further dilution – perhaps another ~10–15% option pool and ~15% new investor stake – which could drop founders into the ~25% or lower range. That would be consistent with many late-stage startups where founders end up in the 10–20% range by exit
_reddit.com_
. But at Series C, 30% for founders is an enviable position that reflects very favorable fundraising terms.

In summary, this aggressive cap table scenario demonstrates how a dual-use defense software startup can raise significant capital (Seed €10M, Series A €60M, Series B €200M, Series C €150M+) and reach a €1B+ valuation while founders retain a sizable equity stake (~30%). Each round’s 10% ESOP ensures the company can attract top talent (critical in AI/defense), at the cost of some dilution. Such outcomes are increasingly seen in the defense/AI sector – investors are pouring money into promising companies, allowing higher valuations and slightly less dilution per round than historically. The trade-off for the founders is that they must execute on the lofty expectations that justified those valuations; but if they do, the cap table sets them up to reap significant rewards alongside their investors and team. This aligns well with norms in today’s high-growth ventures: founders sell less of their company to reach milestones than a decade ago
_tomtunguz.com_
, especially in hot sectors, and our scenario embodies that trend. The cap table remains competitive and realistic, illustrating a path from inception to unicorn that preserves founder equity as much as possible while still being credible in the eyes of venture investors (each investor got a fair share for their risk).

Overall, this scenario is aggressive but plausible – it underscores how a strong defense/AI startup can navigate fundraising to minimize dilution, and it highlights the importance of high valuations, staged ESOP allocations, and careful dilution management in reaching a billion+ valuation with founders still holding meaningful ownership.
