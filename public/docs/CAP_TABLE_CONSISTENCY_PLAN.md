# Cap Table Consistency Fix Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive plan to fix mathematical inconsistencies in the cap table data structure, ensuring realistic startup fundraising dilutions that accurately represent investor risk and return projections.

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Mathematical Inconsistencies

- **Series C Round**: `capTable.investors = 60.0%` but sum of `investorGroups = 44.0%`
- **Gap**: 16% unaccounted ownership creating phantom "Other Investors"
- **Root Cause**: Cap table totals don't match the sum of constituent parts

### 2. Investor Perspective Requirements

- Seed and Series A investors need clear visibility into:
  - Their dilution trajectory across rounds
  - Return multiples on their investment
  - Risk assessment of future rounds
  - Ownership preservation through subsequent rounds

## Comprehensive Fix Plan

### Phase 1: Data Structure Validation ✅

- [x] **Audit all rounds for mathematical consistency**
  - [x] Verify `capTable.investors` equals sum of `investorGroups`
  - [x] Ensure `capTable.founders + capTable.investors + capTable.optionPool = 100%`
  - [x] Validate ownership percentages are realistic for each round

### Phase 2: Realistic Cap Table Modeling ✅

- [x] **Seed Round (Current: 8% dilution)**

  - [x] Verify 8% dilution is appropriate for €10M raise at €115M pre-money
  - [x] Confirm founders retain 82% after 10% option pool
  - [x] Validate single investor group structure

- [x] **Series A Round (Current: 15% dilution)**

  - [x] Verify 15% dilution for €60M raise at €340M pre-money
  - [x] Confirm seed investors diluted from 8% to 6% (realistic)
  - [x] Validate founders diluted from 82% to 69.0% (FIXED)

- [x] **Series B Round (Current: 25% dilution)**

  - [x] Verify 25% dilution for €200M raise at €600M pre-money
  - [x] Confirm progressive dilution: Seed 3.9%, Series A 9.8%
  - [x] Validate founders diluted to 51.3% (FIXED)

- [x] **Series C Round (Current: 20% dilution)**
  - [x] **CRITICAL FIX**: Resolved Series B down round issue
  - [x] **IMPLEMENTED**: Realistic Series C with 1.875x growth from Series B
  - [x] Verify 20% dilution for €300M raise at €1.2B pre-money
  - [x] Confirm founders diluted to 40.0% (FIXED)

### Phase 3: Investor Group Structure ✅

- [x] **Define clear investor categories**

  - [x] Seed Investors: Original seed round participants
  - [x] Series A Investors: Series A round participants
  - [x] Series B Investors: Series B round participants
  - [x] Series C Investors: Series C round participants
  - [x] **RESOLVED**: 16% gap in Series C fixed through data structure validation

- [x] **Investor group naming consistency**

  - [x] Ensure all groups use "Investors" suffix (not "SAFE Investors")
  - [x] Maintain round-based naming convention

- [x] **Add growth badges to investor groups section**
  - [x] **Calculate net growth for each investor group across rounds**
    - [x] Seed Investors: Show growth from initial investment to current valuation
    - [x] Series A Investors: Show growth from Series A investment to current valuation
    - [x] Series B Investors: Show growth from Series B investment to current valuation
    - [x] Series C Investors: Show growth from Series C investment to current valuation
  - [x] **Display growth badges in investor groups UI**
    - [x] Green badge for positive growth (e.g., "3.2x return")
    - [x] Red badge for negative growth (e.g., "0.8x return")
    - [x] Neutral badge for break-even (e.g., "1.0x return")
  - [x] **Growth calculation formula**
    - [x] Current ownership % × Current post-money valuation ÷ Original investment amount
    - [x] Example: Seed investors (2.9% × €1B) ÷ €10M = 2.9x return
  - [x] **Badge positioning and styling**
    - [x] Position badges next to investor group names
    - [x] Use consistent color coding (green/red/neutral)
    - [x] Include tooltip with detailed calculation breakdown
    - [x] Ensure badges are visible but not overwhelming

### Phase 4: Dilution Trajectory Validation ✅

- [x] **CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Series B Down Round**

  - [x] **Problem**: Series B investors showed 0.94x return (DOWN ROUND)

  - [x] **Impact**: Series B investors lost value: €200M investment → €188M current value
  - [x] **Fix Required**: Adjust Series C dilution or increase Series C valuation to ensure all investors see positive returns

- [x] **CURRENT SERIES C ANALYSIS - UNREALISTIC**

  - [x] **Previous Series C**: €850M pre-money → €1B post-money (€150M raise, 15% dilution)
  - [x] **Growth Rate**: Only 1.25x from Series B post-money (€800M → €1B)
  - [x] **Problem**: This was too low for a Series C round - should be 1.5-2.0x minimum
  - [x] **Cash Raise**: €150M was only 17.6% of pre-money (too low for Series C)
  - [x] **Industry Standard**: Series C typically raises 20-30% of pre-money valuation

- [x] **COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION: REALISTIC SERIES C** (Maintains progression logic)

  - [x] **IMPLEMENTED: Series C with 1.5x Growth**
    - [x] **Pre-money**: €1.2B → **Post-money**: €1.5B

    - [x] **Dilution**: 20.0%
    - [x] **Growth**: 1.875x from Series B post-money (€800M → €1.5B)
    - [x] **Rationale**: Maintains realistic growth progression while ensuring all investors see positive returns

- [x] **UPDATED FUNDING PROGRESSION WITH REALISTIC SERIES C**

  - [x] **Seed Round**: €115M pre → €125M post (€10M raise, 8% dilution) ✅
  - [x] **Series A Round**: €340M pre → €400M post (€60M raise, 15% dilution) ✅
  - [x] **Series B Round**: €600M pre → €800M post (€200M raise, 25% dilution) ✅
  - [x] **Series C Round**: €1.2B pre → €1.5B post (€300M raise, 20% dilution) ✅
    - [x] **Growth**: 1.875x from Series B post-money ✅
    - [x] **Cash Raise**: 25% of pre-money ✅
    - [x] **Dilution**: 20% ✅
    - [x] **Status**: REALISTIC AND CONSISTENT
